# Crumb 🍪
**The messy part, managed.**

* **Smart Parsing:** Extracts structured recipe data from any web URL.
* **Social Feed:** Instagram-style community feed with asynchronous image loading.
* **Journal:** Supabase-backed persistence for logging bake ratings and notes.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** SwiftUI (MVVM Architecture)
* **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
* **APIs:** Spoonacular API
* **Frameworks:** CoreSpeech, AVFoundation, Combine
